# Yellow Lab Tools

Online tool designed to help Front-End developers optimize their website

[![Dependency Status](https://gemnasium.com/gmetais/YellowLabTools.svg)](https://gemnasium.com/gmetais/YellowLabTools)


## How it works

The tool is based on the fabulous [Phantomas](https://github.com/macbre/phantomas) by Maciej Brencz, that loads a page and collects many web performance metrics.
I rewrote some modules to deeper analyse Javascript interactions with the DOM (especially with jQuery).
And then it is wrapped inside a small NodeJS server to get an interface (inspired by my favorite tool: [WebPageTest](http://www.webpagetest.org/)).

**There are so many things left to do, your help would be greatly appreciated! Please report bugs, ask for evolutions and come code with me.**
